We charted a clockwise loop across the central Azores, combining volcanic hikes with crew endurance drills.

- **Ponta Delgada** provided provisioning and a briefing with local meteorologists.
- **Furnas hot springs** doubled as recovery sessions after overnight passages.
- **Pico vineyards** became a living lesson in resilience engineering—stone corrals shielding vines like blast walls.

Horta's Peter Café Sport hosted our final retro, complete with gin do mar and route sketching.
