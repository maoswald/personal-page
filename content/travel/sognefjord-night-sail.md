We left Bergen at sunset to catch slack tide at the fjord entrance. The crew rotated through radar, AIS, and visual lookout roles every 30 minutes. Balestrand greeted us with pastel skies at 03:30.

Highlights:

- Practiced silent commands to minimize wake-up calls for off-watch crew.
- Logged waypoint annotations directly into the nav tablet for the travel map sync.
- Debriefed with cinnamon rolls and local history lessons after docking.
