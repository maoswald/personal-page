Below you will find live sandboxes and case studies that shaped my consulting practice.

1. **Cloud Map Lab** visualizes multi-region telemetry so product teams can explore reliability trends without digging through
 dashboards.
2. **Crew Ops Canvas** packages the rituals, metrics, and artifacts I use to bootstrap platform squads in complex organizations.
3. **Sailing Logger** syncs GPS tracks from offshore passages into knowledge basesâ€”proving patterns later reused for travel stor
ies on this site.

Each card links to GitHub or demos so you can inspect architecture notes, IaC, and UX flows in detail.
