I work at Deloitte Consulting in Germany, guiding clients through IT and cloud transformation. I combine technical depth with business impact: untangling complex IT landscapes, adopting cloud at scale, and designing people-centric operating models.

I hold an M.Sc. in Computer Science and began as a mechatronic technician—grounding strategy in hands-on problem solving so technology decisions deliver real-world value.

Beyond work, I travel and sail. Skippering sharpened leadership, teamwork, and calm decision-making under pressure—lessons that resonate far beyond the sea.

Curiosity drives growth. Whether guiding IT transformation, navigating new waters, or exploring new cultures, I connect people, ideas, and experiences to create lasting impact.
