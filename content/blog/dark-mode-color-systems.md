Designing for dark surfaces means balancing contrast ratios with atmospheric nuance. I start by mapping luminance ladders that meet WCAG 2.1 AA, then inject accent hues with tight saturation control.

- **Neutrals first.** Establish a grayscale that supports legible text and subdued UI elements.
- **Accent gradients.** Use two-tone gradients for hero backgrounds, ensuring the lightest value still meets contrast requirements with white text.
- **Testing kit.** Contrast checkers, device previews, and the new CSS `color-mix()` help preview states efficiently.

Dark themes can feel premium and perform brilliantly when they center human perception.
