Baltic spots reward patience. Sandbanks shift weekly and the wind can jump from 12 to 28 knots within a session. My playbook includes:

- **Tide tables and depth soundings** synced to my Garmin inReach.
- **Crew checks** mirroring incident response pre-flight rituals.
- **Micro-retros** after each run: what went well, what to tweak.

The same systems thinking from platform ops keeps sessions safe and joyful.
