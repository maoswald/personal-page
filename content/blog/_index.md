Welcome to the long-form logbook where I pair enterprise cloud work with lessons from life offshore.

- **Cloud transformation journals** break down operating-model experiments, platform guardrails, and coaching rituals that stuc
k with client teams.
- **Design and product notes** capture how UX heuristics, facilitation frameworks, and storytelling sharpen technical delivery.
- **Adventure dispatches** translate sailing passages and cultural discoveries into insights on leadership, resilience, and play.

Each story links to supporting artefacts—GitHub repositories, templates, and travel tracks—so you can remix them for your own p
ath.
