Sardinia rewards slower travel. We scheduled longer layovers to connect with local cooperatives and map supply chains for provisioning.

Highlights include:

- **Olbia markets** where we sourced seasonal produce and shared platform analogies with shopkeepers.
- **La Maddalena archipelago** for tidal navigation drills.
- **Alghero retrospectives** on a rooftop terraceâ€”combining crew check-ins with storytelling.

Every harbor becomes a classroom when curiosity leads.
