The hero of this site needed to hold two narratives: consulting in complex IT landscapes and life at sea. Instead of stacking them, the split identity hero creates tension and clarity.

Key moves:

1. **Contrasting panels.** One side leans into deep blues and structured typography. The other uses softer gradients and organic shapes to hint at motion.
2. **Shared anchor.** The tagline stays centered and acts as a bridge. Visitors understand that I operate in both domains with a common mindset.
3. **Accessible motion.** Animations respond to `prefers-reduced-motion`. Visitors get subtle cues without distraction.

The result? A hero that feels like a living introduction, not just a banner.
